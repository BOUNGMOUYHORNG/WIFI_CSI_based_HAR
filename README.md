# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on WiFi CSI data

This is a repository with source code for thesis "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on WiFi CSI data"

Using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) is a novel way of sensing and hu-man activity recognition (HAR). Such a system can be used in medical institutions for their patients monitoring without privacy violence, as it could be with a vision-based approach.

The main goal of this thesis was to explore current methods and systems whichuse Wi-Fi CSI, conduct experiments to analyze how different hardware configura-tions affect the data and possibility to detect human activity, collect the dataset andbuild the classification model for HAR task. 8 experiments were performed, the dataset in 3 different rooms was collected, and LSTM-based classification model was build and trained.  Weâ€™ve shown the full pipeline of building Wi-Fi CSI based system.
